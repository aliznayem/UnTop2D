## UnTop2D: Finite element-based optimization procedure for an irregular domain with unstructured mesh

This is a computer program with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python
programming language as a general tool to optimize statically loaded 2-dimensional structures. The program can
optimize both structured and unstructured mesh. The design domain needs not to be regular in
shape. The mesh can be imported from some professional meshing software like Abaqus,
Ansys and Gmsh. Specific elements can be set to freeze so that they cannot be removed
during the optimization. There is also an option to set the wall elements (elements adjacent to
design domain walls) to freeze. Each optimization iteration can be graphically viewed in the
software. The resulting optimized mesh can be exported to Abaqus (INP) format to perform
further structural analysis. There is also an option to export the optimized mesh to STL
format which can be used for 3D printing.
